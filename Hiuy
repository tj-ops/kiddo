You'll notice that not all aircraft in our fleet are equipped with either the older livery, or that of the new 2017 livery. While most people are content with flying the generic livery around, we also take into consideration that some may want to show off our immensely beautiful livery around the globe. Therefore, pilots are free to use any of the following replacement aircraft on routes that use a generic livery. Please note if you do not want to you the generic livery, you must use the corresponding aircraft below.

DH8C --> DH8D
E190 --> CRJ9
A320 --> A319
B78M --> A321
B788 --> B789
A220 --> A321
